    <h3>Summary</h3>
    As a passionate disciple of Jesus Christ I find great joy in talking about the full life that Jesus calls us to. In all that I do in my life I seek to live into that call. My call to ministry first and foremost is being an active disciple for Jesus Christ. Secondly, as We live in a culture where we are more connected to each other than ever my call is to consult with churches and businesses as well in effective use of social media, web design and broadcast through streaming. Through social media, web design, and audio and visual engagement we are able to extend communication in a new and fresh way like never before. Additionally,I have a calling to advocate for physical, mental, and emotional health and seek to use my personal trainer certification to help people reach those goals.
